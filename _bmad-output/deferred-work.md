# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 7-5-configuration-des-rapports-preferences-whatsapp (2026-04-02)

- `WhatsAppPort.isConfigured()` has a `default return true` — any new adapter that forgets to override would silently send real test reports. Consider making the method abstract, or at minimum adding a code smell lint rule. Pre-existing design decision; not caused by Story 7.5 changes.
